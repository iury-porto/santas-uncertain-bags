 In this challenge, participants have to pack toys of different kinds into gift bags, with a total weight limit per bag. If the bag exceeded a certain weight, it is not carried by Santa's elves and thus yields no points. The goal is to divide a list of toys into 1000 different bags so that each bag has at least 3 toys and the total weight carried is maximized. The caveat is that the individual weights of each toy is not known, only the Probability Density Function according to which the weighte of each kind of toy is distributed.
 
 The approach used was the following:
 
 1) The PDF of the weight distribution of a bag that contains a certain composition of toys is found. By composition we mean the number of each kind of toys that were add to a particular bag. The Random Variable of the total weight of the bag is the sum of the RVs representing each toy that was added. Thus, the PDF of the weight of the bag is the convolution of the PDFs of all toys added. If the bag has a sufficiently number of toys, the PDF of the weight of the bag can be approached by a Gaussian RV, with mean and variance equal to the sum of the means and variances, respectively, of the individual RVs that compose the bag, as per the Central Limit Theorem.
 
 2) Find the expected value of a certain bag composition. The value of a bag is its weight, if its below the weight limit, or zero, if its above. Thus, the expected value of a bag is the integral, from 0 to the weight limit, of 'w*f(w)', in which 'w' is the weight and 'f(w)' is the PDF of the weight of the bag applied to 'w'.
 
 3) Find whether adding an item to a bag reduces the expected value of the bag. This is done simply by calculating the new expected value after adding the item and comparing to the previous expected value.
 
 4) Create a list containing all the bag compositions that cannot be improved by the removal of an item. This means, if any item added to the bag reduced the expected value of the bag, that bag composition is suboptimal and won't be in this list. To find this list a combinatorial search is performed, starting with bags of size 1 and checking all possible bag compositions up to a size in which no more item can be added without reducing the expected value. To avoid the combinatorial for large bag sizes, the suboptimal compositions found are stored and pruned from the combinatorial search tree. This step yields a list that have all the possible bags compositions paired with its the expected value.
 
 5) If the number of toys of each kind was unlimited, the greatest expected score would be achieved by using the composition with the greatest expected value for all bags. However, the number of toys of each kind is limited, and can be depleted, making all the compositions that use that kind of toy unavailable for the rest of still unfilled the bags. This is discrete optimization problem with constraints. Several search algorithms were tested for this step, generating the final lists of bags submitted for the challenge.
 
 6) (unimplemented) On a final step, one could improve the scores by trying to discover individual weights for certain toys. This could be achieved by using the 3 submissions per day for the 50 days the challenge last to estimate the weights of up to 150 toys, and use this known toys to improve score, for instance, by using the same list of 999 bags and only modifying the last one.
